# Gamefinder
Introducing an Ebay developer application specifically tuned to monitor listings of gaming products.  Give it a try, monitoring the API gives you a heads up over watching the main website!

## Registration
The very first thing you need to do is register for API access on the Ebay Developer Program at https://developer.ebay.com.  Ebay will take around one complete business day to turn around the registration and approve it.  Once this step is done you can continue to the Access Keys section below.

## Access Keys
In order to access the Ebay API, you will need a set of four different production credentials.  This includes the App ID, Dev ID, Cert ID, and Token.  It is extremely important you keep this information from public eyes, as it is your way into the Ebay environment.

Visit https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/gs_create-the-ebay-api-keysets.html to continue creating Ebay Developer Program production keys for API access use with your Gamefinder installation.
